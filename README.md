### 2018

	○ Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting with Hard Attention to the Task (ICML 2018)
	[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01423.pdf
	
	○ Generative replay with feedback connections as a general strategy for continual learning
	[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10635.pdf
	
	- Shows that EWC fails when task identity needed to be inferred.
	- Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no or negligible loss in performance.
